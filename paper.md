# Abstract

# Introduction

Datasets representing route networks are central to transport planning.
Unlike other key types of data used in transport planning, route
networks are both a key input *and* key output. Origin-destination, GPS,
and remote sensing imagery datasets are all key inputs but rarely
feature as outputs of transport models. Global and local estimates of
costs and benefits associated with changes to transport systems,
geographic outputs at regional, local and corridor level, and
visualisation of agents on the system are common outputs. However, route
network datasets are ubiquitous as both transport model inputs
(typically representing road networks) outputs (typically with model
outputs such as flow per time of day).[^1]

This raises the question, what are transport network datasets? The
intuitive definition is that route network datasets are digital
representations of footpaths, cycleways, highways and other ways along
which people and goods can travel. More formally, transport network
datasets must contain, at a minimum, geographic information on the
coordinates of vertices (points along ways) and edges (the straight
lines between vertices representing ways). Usually they also contain
attributes associated with these ways. File formats for representing
them include Transportation Network Test Problem (TNTP and stored as a
series of `.tntp` plain text files, examples of which can be found in
[github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks](https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks)),
`.DAT` files used by the proprietary SATURN transport modelling system
and XML-based `.osm` or `.pbf` files that encode OpenStreetMap data.

A more recent approach is to represent transport networks in standard
geographic file formats. In this approach, used in the present paper,
transport networks are represented as a series of non-overlapping
linestrings, with attributes such as way type and flow. Making transport
datasets compliant with the ‘simple features’ geographic data
specification in this way has many advantages compared with the
proliferation of formats used by proprietary software, enabling more
easier sharing of datasets between people and programs. The simple
features standard is formalised by the International Organization for
Standardization in [ISO
19125-1:2004](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html) and implemented
in a wide range of file formats such as ESRIs shapefile, GeoJSON, and
the open standard for geographic data, GeoPackage. For ease of data
sharing, we share transport networks used in this paper as plain text
GeoJSON files.

Much research has focussed on generating and modelling transport network
datasets. This is unsurprising given the importance of transport
networks as inputs and outputs of transport models. Much has been
written about network ‘cleaning’ and simplification as a pre-processing
step in transport modelling.
<!-- Todo: add papers on network cleaning and simplification. -->
However, there has been relatively little research into transport
network visualisation, despite the importance of visualisation to enable
more people to understand transport models, for informing policies and
prioritising investment in transport planning.

Morgan and Lovelace (2020) presented methods for combining multiple
overlapping routes into a single route network with non-overlapping
linestrings for visualisation, implemented in the function `overline()`.
The approach takes overlapping linestrings representing multiple routes
and combines them into a single network with non-overlapping
linestrings. The approach has been used to visualise large transport
networks, informing investment decisions in transport planning
internationally. However, the ‘overline’ approach, without further
processing, has limitations:

- It does not remove redundant vertices, which can lead to large file
  sizes and slow rendering.
- It does not remove redundant edges, which can lead to visual
  artefacts.
- Parallel ways that are part of the same corridor are not merged into a
  single way, resulting in outputs that are difficult to interpret.

The final point is most relevant to the present paper. An example of the
issue is shown in [Figure 1](#fig-pct) from the Propensity to Cycle Tool
for England (PCT), with segment values representing daily commuter
cycling potential flows (Lovelace et al. 2017). The left panel shows
Otley Road with a flow value of 818 ([Figure 1 (a)](#fig-otley-road)).
The right panel, by contrast, shows three parallel ways parallel to
Armley Road with flow values of 515 (shown), 288 and 47 (values not
shown) ([Figure 1 (b)](#fig-armley-road)). Although this section of
Armley road has a higher cycling potential than the section of Otley
Road shown (515 + 288 + 47 \> 818), this is not clear from the
visualisation.

A subsequent step described in the paper is to post-process the
geographic representation of the transport network into a raster image,
which can be used to visualise the network. The ‘rasterisation’ stage
can tackle some of the issues associated with multiple parallel ways,
but introduces new issues, as shown in [Figure 2](#fig-rasterisation).

The methods presented in this paper are designed to take a complex
network as an input and output a simplified network, while preserving
the spatial structure of the network and relevant attribures. By
reducing duplicated parallel lines and other intricacies, the outputs
can enable easier-to-interpret visualisations of transport behaviour on
the network patterns and behaviors.

The aim of this paper is to outline approaches for visualising transport
networks that address the issues associated with multiple parallel ways.
Furthermore we present solutions, implemented with open source software
for reproducible and scalable results, to support better visualisation
of transport networks for more evidence-based and sustainable transport
planning.

[Section 3](#sec-methods) describes the input datasets and methods used
to generate the results presented in this paper.
[Section 4](#sec-results) presents the results, illustrated by network
maps of the example datasets. Finally, [Section 5](#sec-discussion)
discusses the results and outlines future work.

# Data

# Methods

Two fundamental approaches to simplifying transport networks are:

- Simplifying the geometry of the network, by removing redundant
  vertices and edges and/or by merging parallel ways and *then* merging
  the attributes of the original network onto the simplified network.
- Iteratively removing edges and updating the attributes of the
  remaining edges by routing through the network.

In this paper we will focus on the former approach, which assumes that a
simplified geographic representation of the network is available.

## Geometry simplification

A prerequisite of simple networks is simple geometries.

### Topology-preserving simplification

Topology-preserving simplification reduces the number of vertices in a
linestring while preserving the topology of the network. As shown in top
panel of [Figure 3](#fig-topology-preserving), topology-preserving
simplication *can* reduce the number of edges, but fails to merge
parallel lines in complex geometries, as shown in the the bottom panel
in [Figure 3](#fig-topology-preserving).

### Simplification with parallel edge removal

A more aggressive approach is to simplify and alter network topology in
a single step, “through the removal of duplicate or parallel edges, and
combining simply-connected nodes” (Deakin 2023).

<!-- An approach to simplification with parallel edge removal is described in the `buffer-aggregate` document that accompanies this paper. -->

## Merging simple and detailed networks

After you have a simplified version of the network, from any source, the
next step is merging the attributes.
