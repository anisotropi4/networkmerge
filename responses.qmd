Dear Prof. Arribas-Bel, reviewers and editorial team,

We thank you for the opportunity to revise our manuscript and for the constructive feedback provided by the reviewers. We have carefully considered all comments and suggestions and we are confident that the revisions have improved the manuscript. Below, we provide a detailed response to each of the reviewers' comments.

...

To help the review process, we have numbered each of the reviewers' comments and provided our responses with reference to these.

# Reviewer 1

- [ ] **R1.1** Expand all sections except "Data and Methods" and "Introduction" (e.g., "Application to Edinburgh City Centre" is only 3 sentences).

<!-- TODO: Check over the sections (RL) -->

- [ ] **R1.2** Improve transitions between text sections to reduce choppiness.

# Reviewer 2

- [x] **R2.1** Add a section comparing the two algorithms, including performance, limitations, and guidance on when to use each.

We have added a new section titled "Skeletonization versus Voronoi" which compares the two algorithms, compares their performance with reference to performance and size.
Importantly, we now highlight the performance benefits of the skeletonization approach for large networks, also highlighting the smoother output of the Voronoi approach.

- [ ] **R2.2** Compare results to ground truth data.

<!-- TODO:
We compared the outputs of our simplification methods against an independent and authoritative source of road network data, Ordnance Survey's OpenRoads data product. -->


- [x] **R2.3** The parenx API is rather unusual. One would assume that a Python package could be imported and used in memory, but this does not seem to be the case as the only documented API is the CLI. Which is strange in itself. Instead of using something like `parenx skeletonize in.geojson out.geojson` and `parenx voronoi in.geojson out.geojson`, which is a common model, it registers `skeletonize.py` and `voronoi.py`, suggesting a Python file rather than a function name. With proper documentation this is probably fine, I just find these choices really weird and incompatible with the rest of the ecosystem. 

We have updated the implementation of the methods in the `parenx` package, which has been updated on PyPI and GitHub:

- The package now exposes the core simplfication functions in the `parenx` namespace, so users and developers can import them directly in their Python code. These improvements are highlighted in the following example from the updated `parenx` documentation (previously this would have generated an error):

```python
import geopandas as gp
from parenx import skeletonize_frame, voronoi_frame, skeletonize_tiles, get_primal

CRS = "EPSG:27700"
filepath = "data/rnet_princes_street.geojson"
frame = gp.read_file(filepath).to_crs(CRS)

parameter = {"simplify": 0.0, "buffer": 8.0, "scale": 1.0, "knot": False, "segment": False}
r = skeletonize_frame(frame["geometry"], parameter)

parameter = {"simplify": 0.0, "scale": 5.0, "buffer": 8.0, "tolerance": 1.0}
r = voronoi_frame(frame["geometry"], parameter)

primal = get_primal(r)
```

See the appendix for more details on the CLI and the API.

- We have updated the function names to be more descriptive, e.g. `get_nx()` is now `get_primal()`, matching the description in the paper.
- We have provided a command-line interface (CLI) that works from shell environments, allowing users to run the methods without needing to write Python code. The CLI uses the command `parenx` and, as the reviewer suggested, takes the algorithm name as the first argument (either `skeletonize` or `voronoi`, without needing the `.py` suffix). 

- [ ] **R2.4** Reconcile the title's focus on "transport planning" with other mentioned applications.
- [ ] **R2.5** Provide the appendix (cookbook and methods section) for review.

- [x] **R2.6** Remove "->" on p. 2, line 14.

Done.

- [x] **R2.7** Update "Fleischmann and Vybornova n.d." to "10.5311/JOSIS.2024.28.319".

Done.

- [x] **R2.8** Update "Suri et al. n.d." to "10.14778/3494124.3494149".

Done.

- [x] **R2.9** The buffer chosen in section 3.1 is 8. Why? Is it better than 7 or 9? How is this determined? How should a user specify this in their case study?

We have clarified in section 3.1 that the 8 m buffer was chosen to reflect UK road widths, referencing the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) and standard rail track separation. This value is now justified. We also state that the `buffer` argument in the simplification functions can be used to adjust the buffer size depending on reader/user needs in the main body of the paper.

- [x] **R2.10** P.5 l.31 contains a typo "skeltonisation". 

Done.

- [x] **R2.11** This may be in the appendix, which I haven't received, but the main text would also benefit from understanding the resolution of the raster component in skeletonisation and the reasoning behind it. 

We have explained the transformation and how it influences the results, e.g. to reduce the 'wiggliness' of the skeletonized output. We now state in the main body of the paper:

> This scale operation is a uniform affine scale transformation applied to increase the detail contained in the raster image. An increase in scale reduces undulation but at the cost of longer processing time and increased memory, which varies as the square of scale value. This transformation is scaled to ensure that the projected coordinate geometry of the network aligns accurately with the corresponding dimensions of the scaled raster image.

We now include the appendix in the submission.

- [x] **R2.12** Explain the segmentation step of the Voronoi-based approach and its effect on results.

Details were included in the appendix, which is now included in the submission and appropriately referenced in the main body of the paper. 

- [ ] **R2.13** Add titles for columns in figures.
- [x] **R2.14** Clarify what the "primitive mesh" in Figure 3 is and how it was created.
- [ ] **R2.15** Enlarge images in Figure 3 for better visibility of differences.

# Reviewer 3

- [ ] **R3.4** Specify the "new contexts" mentioned in the abstract.
- [x] **R3.5** Address issue #145.

- [x] **R3.16** Complete the last sentence of section 3.1 (skeletonization).
- [ ] **R3.17** Shorten or move the "joining route networks" subsection to discussion/future work if it's not part of `parenx` or the Edinburgh use case.
- [ ] **R3.18** Expand the "Application to Edinburgh" section, covering: why this use case, its particularities, goal of simplification, what readers should notice in Figure 4, evaluation of methods, and differences between `parenx` methods.
- [ ] **R3.19** Rephrase "we believe it has applications.." in the conclusion to be more confident about the applications and specify them.
