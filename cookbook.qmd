# Introduction

The `parenx` module was developed as part of this work.[^1] However, as *beta software* it is not well documentmed nor intuative to install and use.

This cookbook, consisting of a number of examples based on real datasets used in the development and testing of the network merge paper[^2], may make using the scripts a bit less painful.
