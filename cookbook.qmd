# Introduction

This cookbook is an addendum of the network merge paper[^1], and consists of a number of examples based on real datasets used in the development and testing. As part of this for the paper the standalone `parenx` module[^2] was developed and deployed to `pypy`. However, noting this is **beta software**, it is clear this module is neither well documentmed nor intuiative and use. So the hope is that by sharing these examples will make using these scripts a bit less painful.
