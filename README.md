Welcome to the networkmerge project.

The code in this repo was developed to support the Network Planning Tool
for Scotland, which can be found at
[www.npt.scot](https://www.npt.scot).

For reproducibility, run the code in the
[devcontainer](./.devcontainer), follow the installation instructions in
the [publish.yml](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) and try running the
following command, after cloning the repo and changing into the repo
directory:

``` bash
quarto render paper.qmd
```

See the rendered result, which automatically updates after each commit
to the main branch, at
